basicaly, you ned to install python and run this app in command prompt/console.

first time you run it - it will ask for URL of your steam offers page https://www.steamtrades.com/
then it will ask you for second URL of person who you want to trade with.

first time you insert ypurs - you dont need to insert it again. just hit enter when it akss you for your URL. it is already remembered.

once app finished - you will know which games he has - you want. You will know which games you have - he wants. if any.

Little bonus. if you tun app with: python  appname l

it will try to see if other guy has games on Linux. and tell you which one he has on actual linux. It will give a few false positives very likely. Just look at URL vs name of game.
